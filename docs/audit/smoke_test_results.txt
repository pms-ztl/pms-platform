## Health Checks
Backend health endpoint: curl http://localhost:3001/health
Frontend load test: curl http://localhost:3002

## Environment Requirements (Blockers for Full Testing)

Required to complete smoke tests:
1. Database connection (PostgreSQL + Prisma)
   - Run: npx prisma migrate deploy
   - Run: npx prisma db seed (if seed exists)
2. Redis (optional, for caching)
   - Install/start Redis server
3. Auth configuration
   - JWT_SECRET in .env
   - Session configuration
4. Test user accounts
   - Create test users with different roles

## Summary
VERDICT: Servers are RUNNING and READY for manual smoke testing
NEXT STEP: Set up database + auth, then manually test all 7 flows
COMPILATION: ✅ 100% SUCCESS (backend + frontend both compile cleanly)
